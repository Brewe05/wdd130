        <h2>History</h2>
        <img src="images/th.jpeg" alt="beginning of Urubamba">
        <p>We are a proud family found and run company focussed of bringing families and friends together on an adventure
        that we know will bring you out of your normal day to day life and give you the chance to truly experience this 
        wonderful life you have.
        </p>
        <p>Our founder Owned a piece of land that happened to have a river going through it,
           while growing up his family always went rafting down the river when they needed a break
           from normal life.
           later in his life Brent wanted to share that same joy he had as a child with other families and friends,
           little did he know it then but Urubamba would become a huge success in bringing everyone together while
           once again connecting with their inner child and nature.
